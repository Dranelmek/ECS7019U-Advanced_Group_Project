# Overview:
* Website with a form that the council can fill out to interact with our database
* will also link to the map overlay tool

# How to use:

## from project root:
  cd Frontend/councilsite/frontend
  npm start

    Starts the development server.

  npm run build

    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test

    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
  
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

# Note That:

  The webpage will attempt to fetch data from the back end. 
  If the backend isn't running it will fail and break (defensive programming not in buget)

# To start backend:

## from project root:
  
  cd Backend
  npm start
